# DNDragons
An ASCII Dungeons and Dragons Game made in C++. This was my very first game project. I made it back in 2015 while I was in middle school. I was learning and participating in the coding challenges from the YouTube channel [MakingGamesWithBen](https://www.youtube.com/user/makinggameswithben).

# How to Run

### In Terminal:
1) navigate into the game directory
```
cd game
```
2) type the command:
```
g++ *.cpp -o output
```
3) run the generated output
```
./output
```
